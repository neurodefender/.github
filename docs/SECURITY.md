# Security Policy

Security is our top priority. This document outlines how to report security vulnerabilities and our commitment to handling them responsibly.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in any of the NeuroDefender projects, please follow these steps:

1. **Do Not Publicly Disclose:**  
   Do not share details of the vulnerability publicly until it has been fixed.
2. **Contact Us:**  
   Email our security team at [security@neurodefender.dev](mailto:security@neurodefender.dev) with the following information:
   - A detailed description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - Any potential impact you foresee.
3. **Acknowledgment:**  
   We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 72 hours and provide an estimated timeline for the fix.
4. **Coordinated Disclosure:**  
   We commit to working with you to resolve the issue and will notify the community once a fix has been deployed.

## Our Commitment

- **Prompt Response:** We strive to respond to all security reports quickly.
- **Confidentiality:** We will keep your details confidential and only share vulnerability information with those directly involved in the resolution process.
- **No Retaliation:** We follow a no-retaliation policy for vulnerability reports made in good faith.

Thank you for helping us keep NeuroDefender secure!
